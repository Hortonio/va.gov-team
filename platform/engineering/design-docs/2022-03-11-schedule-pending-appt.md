## Overview

### Objective
The goal is to add the feature to the mobile app to schedule pending appointments. This functionality is currently available in `vets-website` so much of the logic can be utilized in the mobile app.

The intended audience is for the engineering team.

### Background
Currently, the `vets-website` v2 scheduling feature is as follows:

- Pick type of care to schedule an appointment for
   - Check community care eligibility  
   - `/vaos/v0/community_care/eligibility/{type of care}`
   - Receive true or false for type of care
- If type of care is eligible, user can select to make appointment request at VA facility or community cares facility
- User is given list of facilities to choose from
  - Get facility data 
  - `/vaos/v2/facilities?children=true&ids[]={facility id}&ids[]={facility id}`
  - Note: facility id's come from registered facilities in `/v0/user`
  - Get additional facility scheduling information such as services provided and if available to schedule request (including child facilities)
  - `/vaos/v2/scheduling/configurations?facility_ids[]={facility_id}&facility_ids[]={facility_id}`
- User chooses facility
  - Check if able to schedule request at given facility and service 
  - `/vaos/v2/eligibility?facility_id={id}&clinical_service_id={service_type}&type=request`
  - Multiple checks and responses are done here:
      - Is this a Cerner facility? if so, return cerner portal link
      - Is primary facility? if not, ensure veteran has had visit within 12-24 months to proceed
      - Is facility allow scheduled requests?, 
      - Is request limit reached?
- If Community Cares facility, choose provider
  - `/facilities_api/v1/ccp/provider?{coordinate information}`
- Choose desired date and times then schedule appointment request and post appointment request
  - `/vaos/v2/appointments` 
  - See parameters listed in `Detailed Design` below

### High Level Design
Implementation of this feature will be broken into two endpoints. One to determine eligibility at facilities and one create the appointment requests. This will use VAOS v2 process. 

#### Eligibility Endpoint 
Eligibility endpoint will largely follow the logic listed in the background, with the goal of improving the user experience. We will aggregate all consumed APIs at the beginning of the process in order to create a single new endpoint to provide all information needed to schedule a request. It will only list types of care that are supported, along with the facilities that support that type of service. This will benefit the process in multiple ways:
   - Move any business logic from the front end to the back end 
   - Simplify overall backend and front complexity. 
   - Create a better UX experience. Users will know of a service and facility eligibility before selecting it and waiting for a response.  

#### Create Appointment Request 
Create appointment request endpoint will also mirror the same logic of posting appointment request with no changes.

## Specifics

### Detailed Design

#### Eligibility Endpoint 
The backend business logic will mirror the process explained in the background above except rather than only querying the selected service and facilities, we will query all registered facilities to create a comprehensive list. If load times get unacceptably long due to front loading all queries, we will explore pre-caching results.

Note that this is using VAOS v2 endpoint that have not yet been finalized but will be soon. 

New endpoint data structure:
```json
{
   "data": {
      "type": "appointment-eligibility",
      "id": "abe3f152-90b0-45cb-8776-4958bad0e0ef",
      "attributes": {
         "services": [
            {
               "type":"optometry",
               "eligible":"true",
               "cc":[
                  {
                     "name": "Phoenix CC center",

                        "request": "false",
                        "request_reason": "Does not provide chosen service",
                        "direct": "false",
                        "direct_reason": "nil"   
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "name": "Sun Valley CC Center",
                     "city": "Sun Valley",
                     "state": "OH",
                     "eligible": {
                        "request": "true",

                        "direct": "false", 
                        "direct_reason": "nil"
                     }
                  }
               ],
               "cc_providers": [
                  {
                     "name": "Ashinoff, Stephen",
                     "address": "31-75 23rd st, Long Island City, NY 11106",
                     "distance": "0.7 Miles"
                  }
               ],
               "va":[
                  {

                     "state": "WY",
                     "cerner": "true",
                     "eligible": {
                        "request": "false",
                        "request_reason": "Non-primary facility with no visit within 12-24 months",
                        "direct": "false", 
                        "direct_reason": "nil"
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "name": "Dayton VA Medical Center",
                     "city": "Dayton",
                     "state": "OH",
                     "cerner": "true",
                     "eligible": {
                        "request": "true",
                        "request_reason": "nil",
                        "direct": "false", 
                        "direct_reason": "nil"
                     }
                  }
               ]
         }
      ]
      }
   }
}
```
Note: Direct scheduling will be hardcoded to false until direct schedule feature is added.

#### Create Appointment Request 
This endpoint will act as a pass through directly passing the parameters given to the VAOS endpoint `/vaos/v2/appointments`. 

Parameters:
```json
{
   "kind":"clinic",
   "status":"proposed",
   "locationId":"983GC",
   "serviceType":"optometry",
   "reasonCode":{
      "coding":[
         {
            "code":"Other"
         }
      ],
      "text":"Other"
   },
   "comment":"test",
   "contact":{
      "telecom":[
         {
            "type":"phone",
            "value":"7036753607"
         },
         {
            "type":"email",
            "value":"helen.hoenig@va.gov"
         }
      ]
   },
   "requestedPeriods":[
      {
         "start":"2022-03-17T00:00:00Z",
         "end":"2022-03-17T11:59:00Z"
      }
   ],
   "preferredTimesForPhoneCall":[
      "Morning"
   ]
}
```

### Code Location
In `vets-api`, 2 controllers will be created. one for checking eligibility called `appointment_eligibility_controller` and one for creating the appointment requests called `appointment_request_controller`. Serializers, models, and services will be placed in their corresponding folders in `modules/mobile/app`

### Testing Plan
Specs will be written for each service, adapter and controller, to provide full code coverage.

### Logging
Logging will be done similar to how other Mobile API endpoints are logged, through the Rails Logger and Sentry.

### Debugging
Debugging will be done similar to how other Mobile API endpoints are debugged, utilizing logs and Sentry to diagnose issues and testing individual endpoints to isolate issues.

### Caveats
To be determined.

### Security Concerns
N/A

### Privacy Concerns
N/A

### Open Questions and Risks
Will aggregating all external requests at the beginning of the process cause long load times? If so, we may want to precache results. 

This uses new VAOS endpoints that have not yet been finalized. By the time we finalize our implementation, theirs should also be, but we will need to ensure that is the case, so consumed APIs donâ€™t change out from underneath us. 

Are endpoints we'll be consuming reliable enough to have a good user experience?

### Work Estimates
5-6 weeks.

### Alternatives
- Rather than relying on other endpoints, we could create these features from the ground up to ensure we have full control of all parts of development and maintenance but it has been a long established aim of the Mobile API to reuse backend integrations wherever possible and to not add complexity to an already complex system. Creating redundant logic would not serve either of these objectives.

- Use v1 scheduling endpoints. Since v2 will soon be finalized, most likely around the time we finalize the implementation of this feature, it makes sense to use the new process so we don't have to change our process shortly after finishing it. v2 also will be easier to use and will simplify complexity on our side.

### Future Work
Eventually direct scheduling will be added to this flow as it is in `vets-website`
